# Access to Windows compute resources

Consider using [CCSS-RS](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/research-support) servers. Any Cornell-affiliated researcher can request access. 

Usage and availability can be found on their [dashboard](https://status.computing.socialsciences.cornell.edu/#).

Default cost is zero. There may be additional resources that can be made available at some cost.

Desktop computing support is provided through the college-specific IT support, and is not (yet) described here.
