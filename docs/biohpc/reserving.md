# Requesting exclusive access to an entire node

Once logged in to the BioHPC website, go to [https://biohpc.cornell.edu/lab/labres.aspx](https://biohpc.cornell.edu/lab/labres.aspx), choose `Restricted`. You can reserve any node, up to the time limit imposed by your group membership:

- general: 24 hours
- faculty: 3 days
- contributing: 7 days on their contributed node

Typical nodes have between 16 and 32 CPUs, and between 128Gb and 1024Gb of RAM (memory). File storage varies substantially.

> While you have reserved a node, nobody else can access it (unless you explicitly add them to a reservation). If you know you are only using a few CPUs, consider submitting individual jobs.

If using the command line login node, also see [`biohpc_res`](biohpcres) command.
