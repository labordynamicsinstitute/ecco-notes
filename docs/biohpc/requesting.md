# Requesting an account

[Request an account](https://biohpc.cornell.edu/NewUserRequest.aspx,), ask to be associated with the "ecco01" group. That gives you free computing resources on the "Ecco cluster".

Faculty who have contributed to the cluster have their own groups. Students and collaborators can request (or be provided with) access to those privileged resources by requesting that they be added to the specific group. For instance, Lars' collaborators would request to be added to the `ecco_lv39` group, and would then have access to the compute and storage allocations that Lars has paid for.
