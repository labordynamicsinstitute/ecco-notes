# General access to Linux computing

You may want to have more reliable (but sometimes slower) compute resources. If Linux is not a constraint (normally, it should not be), consider the Econ nodes at BioHPC. You will not be subject to crowding, and you may have access to larger resources (CPUs, memory). See the available resources further along.

Default cost is zero if using the "restricted" (ecco) cluster. Additional resources (compute cycles, storage) can be purchased.
