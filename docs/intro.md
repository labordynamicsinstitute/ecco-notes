# Computing notes

Cornell has a decentralized computing support infrastructure. Members of the Economics Department can choose from several options, as needed for a particular project. These pages provide some info, and links for further reading.

## Using these pages

These pages are a continous work-in-progress. They provide information based on contributors' experiences, which probably is incomplete, and occasionally may be out-of-date. The information is currently edited by [Lars](https://github.com/larsvilhuber/).

## Contributing
