# Computing notes

Cornell has a decentralized computing support infrastructure. Members of the Economics Department can choose from several options, as needed for a particular project. These pages provide some info, and links for further reading.

## Using these pages

These pages are a continous work-in-progress. They provide information based on contributors' experiences, which probably is incomplete, and occasionally may be out-of-date. The information is currently edited by [Lars](https://github.com/larsvilhuber/).

## Quick Start

- [Request access to the Econ Computer Cluster ECCO](access) to get started
- [Launch a job on the Econ Computer Cluster ECCO](slurm-quick-start) to develop code with 1 core, or run jobs with 400 cores
- [Reserve a machine on the Econ Computer Cluster ECCO](reserving) if you need exclusive access to a machine (prevent others from running even non-competing jobs)
- [Connect to a CCSS Cloud Computing Solution](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/computing-and-data/cloud-computing-solutions/account-instructions)

## Contributing

If you did not find something on these pages, want to add something to these pages, or think something should be here, [open a Github issue](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/ecco-notes/issues/new/choose)! If you don't know how to create a Github issue, have a look [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart).

... you have [homework](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) to do! In the meantime, contact [Lars](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/lars-vilhuber).
