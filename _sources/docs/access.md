The cluster has a large number of nodes and file servers. The "ecco" nodes, available for authorized users ("ecco01" group) under "Restricted" are free to users. Other nodes can be added and used, should more (and possibly faster resources be needed).

> It is also possible to have BioHPC host your own dedicated node, as some faculty members in the field do. Contact them or Lars to discuss.

This section describes how to obtain BioHPC resources: computing and storage.
